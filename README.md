# CIS4930 Final Project

We propose to train a model to (1) recognize handwritten numbers and (2) recognize spoken numbers ('one' 'two' etc.). We plan to use the MNIST database of handwritten digits, as well as an analogous database of spoken numbers. 

Our project aims to create a spoken-digit recognition model that is made more accurate through training from two modes. This functionality is useful in transcribing digits spoken into a transcription. This project would provide a base in learning how to train a multi-modal model and serves as a base to understand the foundations of more complex and complete speech recognition and speech to text models.
